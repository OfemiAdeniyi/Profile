Hi, Iâ€™m Micheal Adeniyi.

ðŸ‘€ I have a strong background in research, data analysis (Excel, SQL, Tableau), and teaching. I'm skilled in scientific writing, project coordination, and strategic planning, with a passion for leveraging analytical skills to drive impactful decision-making in industries.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm expanding my expertise in Data Storytelling using visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with forward-thinking organizations where I can apply my data-driven insights to foster growth and innovation.

ðŸ“§ You can reach me at oluwafemiadeniyi772@gmail.com ðŸ“ž+2348107347266

âš¡ Fun fact: I once read an entire 250-page book in a single day just because I couldnâ€™t put it down!

ðŸŽ¯ When Iâ€™m not working as a data analyst, I enjoy reading self-development books, watching hilarious movies, and learning to make new dishes.
